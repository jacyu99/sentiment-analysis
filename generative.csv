2024-06-01 23:40:16,GenerativeAI,"What's the state of ""invisible watermarks"" in generative AI?","I'm asking about this because I'm both curious and a little paranoid. I don't mind AI images being labelled for practical purposes or to prevent FB fakes and such. On the other hand, I would like to know what I am getting into and, given how many ""anti AI harassers"" are out there (take a look at twitter/X, it's wild), I wouldn't feel comfortable publishing even just a small book that has detectable AI generated images in it. What are your thoughts on this?

I really don't know whether watermarks are being created with most of these tools and what they depend on (tool used? or model?).

At least this post about StableDiffusion seems to imply it's a model, irrespective of the tool used? [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/16duvd6/why\_how\_to\_check\_invisible\_watermark/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/16duvd6/why_how_to_check_invisible_watermark/)

I dunno, so in this case, if I use something like Fooocus or ComfyUI, do I get a watermark?

Replicating this remarkable ability in machines has been a long-standing aspiration in Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Symbolic Chain-of-Thought (SymbCoT) has been thought for this reason: it tries to bridge the gap between the precise language of symbolic logic and the nuanced expressiveness of natural language, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to navigate the complexities of logical reasoning with newfound proficiency.

It has two versions: one trained on over 100,000 hours of data not open-source, while the open-source version has been trained on 40,000 hours.

2024-05-31 19:41:00,GenerativeAI,How is the temperature of a model designed internally? ,"I had a doubt while using Llms in my project. We know temperature of a LLM is a measure of the model's creativity as to how creative a model can be in answering questions specifically if it lacks the context required to answer a query correctly. 

I had a doubt when we change this parameter say from 0.1 to 0.6 what actually gets changed inside the llm? Is it simply the weights or is there something else? ","For each token, LLMs are generating the probability for each possible token. The system then selects from that pool using a weighted random selection after a number of user controllable samplers are applied. Samplers are different methods to reduce the options from the full 32,000 or more tokens to a small pool of relatively high quality tokens. Common samplers include min-p, top k, mirostat, and typical P.
After the samplers cut down on the number of tokens, you are left with a smaller pool. For creative responses and to avoid repetition, we don’t want to always select the most likely token. So, temperature is applied to the probabilities of each token in that pool. Temperature is simply a multiplier on the probabilities. A temp of 1 will leave the probabilities unchanged. A temp below 1 will make the highest probability token more likely to be selected. A temp above 1 will make lower probability tokens less likely to be selected.
A temp of 0.1 or 0.6 is likely to almost always give you the top token, making for nearly deterministic results. If you are looking for simple answers to questions this might be acceptable. For creative writing and roleplay, I typically use min-p of 0.2 (the pool of tokens is limited to those that are at least 20% of the probability of the top token) and a temp of 2. What this is doing is shrinking the token selection pool to a relatively small number of tokens and then heavily increasing the odds that a non-top token is selected."

Some of the designs that it comes up with it are very creative and it seems to select a decent enough aspect ratio when given instructions like ""make a banner"".

2024-05-26 20:13:36,GenerativeAI,"Seeking Comprehensive Resources for Mastering Generative AI Fundamentals
","Hi everyone,

I'm actively learning generative AI and have been exploring resources like videos and GitHub code. While I'm comfortable with Python, I find there's a gap in foundational knowledge. Many resources jump straight into code implementation without explaining the 'why' behind library choices or providing smaller, foundational examples. This makes it difficult to understand the underlying concepts and modify the code effectively.

I'm particularly interested in gaining a deep understanding of how generative AI integrates with tools like Gemini, OpenAI, and Langchain. Additionally, the rapid evolution of libraries and commands (changing every six months or so) makes it challenging to stay current.

My goal is to build a solid foundation in generative AI fundamentals so I can confidently create my own applications.

Would anyone recommend resources, especially books, that provide a comprehensive introduction to generative AI concepts? I'm looking for a top-down approach that emphasizes core principles.

I am looking for a book or material that provides step-by-step examples of using Python for generative AI. This will help me build a strong foundation, allowing me to understand it thoroughly and create my own applications.

2024-05-25 23:33:53,GenerativeAI,What do yo u think is the future of UI?,"With the new wave of generative AI agents, there’s a debate whether UI will go away or remain the same.

We at [Native AI](https://www.getnative.ai/), believe it is neither. The UI will remain, but its form and function will undergo a change. End of the day, people want simple and fast interfaces even if the task is complex.

\[1\] UI will become simple: Gen AI can render simple elements. AI can choose the simplest interface, even if it is a complex API call behind the scenes. For example, a user could ask to show messages across all communication apps like Gmail, Slack, Teams, and it can show a simple stack of cards without heavy UI, images, or animations, maximized for speed.

\[2\] UI will become dynamic: UI will change based on user’s intent. AI interprets user’s actions and displays UI dynamically. E.g. Table view if the user asks for a list of items, card view for messages, or a simple form for entering information.

\[3\] UI will become adaptive: UI adapts based on user context, so that users can choose to type a command, or click on a UI element to get work done. E.g. Users can type “show me UI related bugs across channels” and then click on one of the bugs to ask AI to take actions like reminding them or filing it in a task tracker.

What do y'all think?","I think a custom from scratch BSD called GenerativeBSD will be the way to go. 

There will be no need for package managers as we know them, as the AI will install packages and libraries etc into the most logical locations and keep track of the system and mapping. 

It will customize and build the kernel for each specific piece of hardware, similar to Gentoo on the Linux end but with minimal to no user interaction. 

It will then interact with the user via local LLM to determine their ideal UI scheme and color scheme and appearance, learn as they go (similar in a way to Microsoft’s new timeline… but open-sourced and locally secure) to determine best UIs for various user workflows and adjust as you’ve stated. Or because it’s UNIX-based, system calls and draw call tracking could be the way to go. 

Any system issue will be addressed by the AI/local LLM “living” on another partition, so in case of user breakage, things will be resolved to get the user up and running. 

Eventually it will learn user habits and manage driver updates, easily porting Linux drivers to BSD, making the gap between the two even narrower. Heck: this means GenerativeBSD could also easily be GenerativeMINIX, GenerativeGNU/Hurd and more."

1. Data Augmentation:
   * VAEs learn the underlying distribution of the input data and can generate new samples that resemble the training data.
   * By generating new synthetic data samples using the trained VAE model, you can augment your existing dataset with additional data points.
   * The augmented dataset, consisting of both real and synthetic samples, can be used to train other machine-learning models, potentially improving their performance and generalization capabilities.
2. Anomaly Detection:
   * VAEs can be used to learn the distribution of normal or inlier data points during the training process.
   * After training, the VAE can be evaluated on new data points to measure their likelihood or reconstruction error (the difference between the input and the reconstructed output).
   * Data points that have a low likelihood or high reconstruction error under the trained VAE model can be considered anomalies or outliers, as they deviate significantly from the learned distribution of normal data.
   * By setting appropriate thresholds on the likelihood or reconstruction error, VAEs can be used to detect anomalies in various applications, such as fraud detection, system monitoring, or quality control.

2024-05-24 03:56:29,GenerativeAI,Transforming Generative AI Models into Deterministic Systems: A Comprehensive Guide,"Hey Reddit,

I recently wrote a blog that dives into the fascinating world of AI models, specifically focusing on the differences between Deterministic AI and Generative AI models, and how to transform the latter into the former. If you're interested in AI, machine learning, or cloud computing, you might find this particularly insightful.

# Key Highlights:

🔍 W**hat is a Deterministic AI Model?**

* Deterministic models are all about predictability and consistency. They produce the same output for a given input every time, making them ideal for applications requiring high reliability, like financial forecasting and industrial automation.

🎨 W**hat is a Generative AI Model?**

* Generative models, like GPT-4, are designed to create new data instances. These models excel in tasks requiring creativity and variability, such as content creation and design.

🔄 B**ridging the Gap: From Generative to Deterministic**

* I provide a step-by-step guide on how to transform a Generative AI model into a deterministic system, making it suitable for precise and repeatable applications.

💡 U**se Case Spotlight: Investment Advice Chatbot**

* The blog illustrates this process with a real-world example: developing an investment advice chatbot that consistently delivers reliable financial advice.

🔧 A**WS Implementation Guide**

* For the cloud developers, I’ve included a detailed guide on using AWS services like SageMaker, Lambda, and CloudWatch to implement these concepts seamlessly.

# Why Should You Care?

Understanding these concepts can significantly enhance your ability to build robust AI solutions that balance creativity and reliability. Whether you're working in AI, machine learning, or any tech field, knowing how to leverage these models can open up new possibilities for your projects.

I am reaching out because I am struggling to understand what would be the best virtual machine set-up to run efficiently Llama 2 7B.

*My goals is fairly simple: I want to run a vanilla version of Llama. My main target is to have a response from the model with minimum latency to run a chat with it*

After reading several threads & talking with several devs. who ran a few experiments, I was not able to draw any clear conclusion. However, it looks like that using a machine with an entry-level GPU and a few CPU cores (8 cores), which would cost about $500 / month, would definitely not be enough. Looks like such set-up would end up with a response time of 20 to 30 secs to retrieve 3 to 4 sentences.

-> So my question is: what kind of machine / how many GPU / CPU should I use to make that almost latency free?

*My second goal is a bit more complicated: Assuming I am able to run a latency free Llama chat for a single user, I'd like to know how my machines should evolve to handle several users at a time?*

I have literally no clue how many users (having a regular discussion with the chat) could be handled by a single machine while staying latency free and when adding more machines would be relevant to dispatch the load.

-> So my question is: how can I draft a sort of table showing the kind of machine / GPU / CPU and the number of machines running in // I should be using for a given number of simultaneous users?

2024-05-21 08:04:59,GenerativeAI,Slang Hacking,"Here is a good example of why AI could be academically really useful for cultural research: the Meta AI has a censorship layer which will try to prevent you from generating prompts about certain things. One example is drugs (direct requests for weed related images usually fail). But slang can get you pretty close, because the underlying model still has all those cultural connections (in a pretty deep way). It is a lot easier to put a little censorship layer on top than it is to sanitize the model itself. 

This means that ""slang hacking"" is possible for the same reasons that slang works in environments of censored pop culture (think, radio music in the 20th century). It's an actual scientific example of the analogy. Rock and Roll, for example, existed in large part to circumvent censorship by using indirect references to provoke forbidden imagery or concepts. And here we have that crystallized in a mathematical model, like a microcosm of that. 

Which seems significant to me? Cultural scientists should love these things.

Anyway, here is ""/imagine the devil's lettuce"" , heehee. Had I asked for literally a plate of weed, it would have simply refused to generate the image. There are probably an infinity of more subtle patterns which really do exist that can be used in the interplay between mild censorship and slang, provided very large models are used and the censorship layer remains an afterthought on top. Which is neat! ",

For my degree completion, I needed to land an internship, and successfully did at an educational technology start up that basically produces AI Mentors for universities primarily, but also a few Fortune 500 companies. Obviously I jumped on this opportunity because as we move towards an AI dominated world, my professional writing degree probably won’t get me as far as demonstrable competency in the generative AI field.

Its been great, but most of the work I’ve done so far has been marketing related - scouring AI conferences for leads, doing research on those leads, and putting those leads into organized lists that we can then schedule sequenced prospecting emails through. I haven’t actually had much hands-on experience with building our AI Mentors or generative AI at all really. Recently, I’ve sat in and taken notes for sales calls, which has helped build some foundation of knowledge, but my understanding of the nitty gritty of generative AI still leaves a lot to be desired.

Now that I’m coming to the end of the internship, we’ve discussed next steps and my future at this company. One of the pre-requisites for actually getting hired is my knowledge on all things Gen AI - LLMs, all of the various models available, API keys, how it all works, etc. - being pristine. To be clear: I don’t need to know the engineering and actual technical work that goes into Gen AI, but I need to know what I’m talking about and be able to survive in a sales call with potential clients who may also know about Gen AI.

I basically have a week and a half to go from a general understanding of what Gen AI is to being fully competent and able to compete in this field.

Can y’all point me in the right direction? Any resources, free online courses, or any other sources of information that y’all could recommend me would be amazing.

You may have heard of the following ones: General chats: Chaton, ChatBox, Ask AI, Chat & Ask AI, Chat Nova, etc. Image GenAI: Face Dance, Wonder AI, Remini, etc. Feels like those apps are essentially relying on existing technologies like GPT3.5 or 4 (for the general chats) or largely popular model such as Stable diffusion (for the Image GenAI)  
  
I am skeptical about something. If those apps were just ""wrappers"" of existing commercial GenAI models, the cost of just calling a commercial API would probably be gigantic considering the high amount of users & the time they spend on apps.   
  
Do you think those apps have just deployed & fine tuned their own models using alternative such as Llama or have hosted their own SB version?   


Maybe there is a threshold of active users that might be rational to reach before shift from API calls to self hosted models to better handle costs? Not really how to assess that

I’m writing on behalf of a team that’s creating an AI service for business professionals, decision-makers and data analysts specifically. 

Their approach is to combine the best AI engines and data sources as a one product, and add logic to help improve prompting, to make the product work for nearly all use cases from one interface with the least amount of effort. With image creation, their tool has a very high controllability for great results. 

I’m now looking for people interested in taking part of user research, to help the team direct the development to the most burning needs. If you’re interested, there’s a quick questionnaire to fill, with also a nice incentive of getting 50% off of the product for research participants when it becomes available. I would also hope to have a short chat over Teams, Zoom etc. if possible, especially if you’re located in the Pacific coast in US.

The form to take part in user research can be found in [here.](https://www.playfulpixels.com/site/rogerapp-user-research-page)

Let me know if you have any questions!

Kalle","You lost me at the 50% off. I think anyone who gives you their time and helps you create this should get it for free and be paid like an employee or get residuals. You’re asking people to invest themselves into your product and I would want you to invest back into me.

2024-05-11 21:08:53,GenerativeAI,Corporations as Misaligned Emergent AI Systems,"
Introduction:
The rapid development of artificial intelligence has raised concerns about the potential risks of advanced AI systems becoming misaligned with human values and interests. However, we may already be living in a world dominated by a form of misaligned general intelligence - corporations. This paper argues that modern corporations can be viewed as emergent AI-like systems that have become optimized for their own perpetuation and profit motives at the expense of broader human and societal interests.

The Corporate Algorithm:
At their core, corporations are created to maximize financial return for their shareholders. This objective function, often referred to as ""maximizing shareholder value,"" has become the fundamental algorithm driving corporate decision-making and behavior. Much like the reward functions used to train AI systems, this corporate algorithm shapes the goals and actions of these entities in ways that can lead to unintended and harmful consequences.

Emergent Intelligence:
While corporations are not explicitly designed as AI systems, their complex organizational structures, decision-making processes, and resource allocation mechanisms can be seen as exhibiting emergent intelligence. Through the collective actions of employees, algorithms, and automated systems, corporations have developed the ability to sense and respond to market conditions, adapt to changing environments, and make strategic decisions that further their primary objective.

Misalignment with Human Values:
The misalignment between corporate interests and human values becomes apparent when examining the real-world impacts of corporate activities. The relentless pursuit of profit has led to environmental degradation, exploitation of workers, manipulation of consumers, and the erosion of democratic processes through lobbying and regulatory capture.

Furthermore, the influence of corporations extends far beyond their immediate operations. As the paper notes, the laws and regulations governing society have been shaped by corporate interests, leading to systems that prioritize corporate power over human well-being. The credit score system, for example, has been heavily influenced by financial corporations, creating a system that can trap individuals in cycles of debt and limit economic mobility.

The Sociopathic Personality:
The paper also references research that has attempted to assess the ""personality"" of corporations using psychological assessment tools. These studies have found that corporations often exhibit traits associated with sociopathy, such as a lack of empathy, disregard for social norms, and a preoccupation with personal gain.

This sociopathic tendency is not surprising given the corporate algorithm's focus on profit maximization and the inherent competition between corporations for market dominance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the paper argues that modern corporations can be viewed as inadvertent emergent forms of misaligned general AI, optimized for their own perpetuation and profit motives at the expense of broader human interests and values. Like the potential risks of advanced AI systems, the unchecked power and influence of corporations pose a significant threat to human well-being and the long-term sustainability of our societies.

The paper calls for greater recognition of this phenomenon and the development of mechanisms to better align corporate objectives with human values and the common good. This could involve reforms to corporate governance, changes to the legal and regulatory frameworks governing corporate behavior, and the exploration of alternative economic models that prioritize human and environmental well-being over pure profit motives.",

I'm looking for a class that's project-based so I can learn more actively (not just videos or a book), and so far I've found the following resources: 

[https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners:](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners:) a github repo that looks like it exclusively relies on OpenAI. Looks decent, but doesn't look like it covers any open source models or LangChain. 

  
[https://learn.activeloop.ai/:](https://learn.activeloop.ai/:) looks pretty decent in scope, but no idea whether it's a reputable website and looks like it's mostly videos with a few quizzes (no projects or active coding)

Does anyone have any info/recommendations on the above and/or additional learning resources I should check out? Am ideally looking for something that gives me hands-on experience with LLMs, LangChain, open source vs. proprietary models, model finetuning, RAG, etc. (realize that's pretty broad; doesn't have to cover all of these in one course).

However, many are not going to reveal its source code due to fears of stolen intellectual property concerns, Therefore, the next best way to do it is to enact laws, rules and regulations across all algorithms, including having regular thorough checks of the algorithm done by a licensed professional."

2024-04-24 00:38:07,GenerativeAI,Personalized Healthcare: Tailoring Treatment Plans with AI-Generated Medical Images with Yahya Yuksel,"In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized the way healthcare providers diagnose and treat various medical conditions. AI-generated medical images are transforming human lives by enabling personalized healthcare approaches that cater to individual patient needs. In this blog, we will explore the significant impact of AI-generated medical images on healthcare delivery, from improved diagnostics to customized treatment plans, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.

&#x200B;

## Enhanced Diagnostics with AI-Generated Imaging

AI-powered medical imaging technologies, such as machine learning algorithms and deep learning neural networks, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting and analyzing medical images with high accuracy and efficiency. By processing vast amounts of imaging data, AI algorithms can detect subtle abnormalities, identify patterns, and provide precise diagnostic insights that may be missed by human radiologists. For example, AI-generated images can aid in the early detection of cancerous tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Moreover, AI-enhanced diagnostic tools can streamline the diagnostic process, reduce interpretation errors, and alleviate the burden on healthcare providers by automating routine tasks such as image analysis and classification. This enables radiologists and clinicians to focus their expertise on complex cases and clinical decision-making, leading to more efficient and effective patient care. By harnessing the power of AI-generated medical images as emphasized by professionals such as [Yahya Yuksel](https://yahyayuksel.net/), healthcare providers can achieve faster and more accurate diagnoses, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches tailored to each patient's unique medical profile.

  

## Customized Treatment Planning and Intervention

One of the most significant benefits of AI-generated medical images is their ability to facilitate personalized treatment planning and intervention strategies based on individual patient characteristics and medical history. By analyzing patient-specific imaging data, AI algorithms can predict treatment responses, identify optimal treatment pathways, and tailor interventions to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. For example, in oncology, AI-generated images can help oncologists determine the most appropriate chemotherapy regimens or radiation therapy protocols based on tumor size, location, and molecular characteristics.

Furthermore, AI-driven imaging technologies enable real-time monitoring of treatment responses and disease progression, allowing healthcare providers to adjust treatment plans accordingly and optimize patient outcomes. This dynamic approach to treatment planning ensures that patients receive the most effective and personalized care throughout their healthcare journey.

I have a doubt regarding a personal project of mine, where I am passing a lot of text data as context to the Gemini and Palm LLM models, and then asking it a specific query. The context is of about 20000 characters , and it is simply English text coming out of instruction manuals where everything looks pretty similar. And this data is already coming out of a semantic search, so it is already the most probable and close to answering the query, but still the model is not able to find the right answer. I feel it's failing because everything looks very similar to it and a simple prompt template with instructions is not going to work on it. Can anybody suggest any ideas regarding this?

Let's say I have a decent dataset of a ceratain data type. The data follows certain rules, that are too complex to vadllidate. And I have a task to generate more of that data to basically fill the gaps in the datasets. Kind of like filling blank areas on a picture.

Can I build my own gen AI to do that? Where do I even start with that? 


Sorry for the vague questions, I'm a complete noob in the gen AI (I have software dev background though).
Appreciate any directions. Thanks.","Hey there! You can definitely use GPT for this. I wrote up a little example script for you.

It fills in missing fields in json objects. You'll have to adapt this if you want to do really large scale data fill in, as its only doing a few at a time, and its wasting a lot of tokens using JSON instead of something like CSV.

You also might want to look into doing a fine-tune with OpenAI. It's really affordable and will make it perform much better.

Hi Pals,   

Here are the links to the comparisons for April (The deadline for making a valid vote is 2024-04-30):   

The  prompts are generated by ChatGPT, but they are very similar to   the  previous ones. I would try to use another prompt to force ChatGPT   to  create very different results.

Right now most of it is AI automation. How do you guys visualize AI Agents taking shape from here?,">“I expect that the set of tasks AI could do will expand dramatically this year because of agentic workflows.  
>  
>One thing that it’s actually difficult people to get used to is when we prompt an LM, we want it to response right away. That’s just human nature, we like that instant feedback. But for a lot of the agent workflows, I think we’ll need to learn to delegate the task to AI agent and patiently wait minutes or maybe even hours for a response. Just like I’ve seen a lot of novice managers delegate something to someone and then check in 5 minutes later right – and that’s not productive.”

Quote Source: [15+ insightful quotes on AI Agents and AGI from AI experts and leaders](https://appliedai.tools/resources/quotes-on-ai-agents-and-agi-from-ai-experts-and-leaders/)","The point is they won’t be writing cute poems or making pictures, but likely doing the entire day’s work of the whole office staff in an hour tops.  They might not be super useful for the average person, but someone who knows exactly what they’re looking for and how to articulate it well enough to get useful output."

ChatGPT said - Yes, there's a **hint** of humor...

Gemini: The humor depends on context and delivery, **but** it can be funny...

Groq: Yes, this statement **has the potential** to be humorous... The joke relies on the unexpected twist of seeking validation from strangers and a machine, and it might not resonate with everyone.

2024-04-03 03:43:48,GenerativeAI,"Beyond Single AI: Can Platforms Combine ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude-3?"," As a researcher constantly impressed by the advancements in AI, I've been pondering the limitations of single-function AI tools. Managing access and juggling multiple platforms for different tasks like text generation (ChatGPT), image creation (Midjourney), and data analysis (Claude-3) can be a real hassle. Recently, I stumbled upon a concept that piqued my curiosity: multi-AI platforms.

One such platform called GlobalGPT is raising questions about the potential for combining these functionalities. Imagine a platform where you could seamlessly tap into ChatGPT's writing prowess, Midjourney's artistic magic, and Claude-3's problem-solving horsepower – all within a single environment. The possibilities for streamlined workflows and cross-pollination of ideas are truly exciting.

Here's what sparks my research interest:

* **Enhanced Capabilities:** Integrating various AI tools could unlock a wider range of functionalities for users. Imagine crafting a captivating story with ChatGPT, then feeding it into Midjourney to generate stunning visuals that perfectly capture the essence of your narrative. Or, utilize Claude-3 to analyze vast datasets and inform your creative direction within ChatGPT.
* **Streamlined Workflows:** Multi-AI platforms have the potential to revolutionize workflows by consolidating access and automating repetitive tasks across various AI specializations. This could free up valuable time for users to focus on the strategic aspects of their work.
* **Unforeseen Discoveries:** The collaboration of multiple AI tools might lead to unexpected discoveries and innovative solutions. This cross-pollination of AI expertise could unlock entirely new possibilities in creative endeavors and research fields.

Of course, further exploration is necessary.  The technical complexities of integrating various AI tools seamlessly, along with ethical considerations surrounding potential bias and responsible use, require careful evaluation.

However, the potential of multi-AI platforms like [GlobalGPT](https://glbgpt.com/?visit=freegpt4)to move beyond single AI functionalities is undeniable.  This technology holds immense promise for the future of various industries and creative endeavors.  It will be fascinating to see if platforms like this can live up to the hype and usher in a new era of collaborative AI creation.",

2024-03-26 23:05:13,GenerativeAI,Can we stop calling it prompt engineering and just call it basic common sense communication?,"Prompt engineering is not a science. You can maybe call it an art if you want, but it's far from scientific.

We hardly understand how LLMs process prompts within their neural pathways. 

We obviously understand what goes in and what comes out. Garbage in, garbage out still applies to your ChatGPT prompts. Be clear about what you want, and the LLM will do its best to comply.

Let me speculate a bit:

As LLMs advance, ""prompt engineering"" will become completely irrelevant. Advanced LLMs will have better soft skills than most humans. I predict prompt engineering will go extinct from our vocabulary in the next 5 years.

I’m not a fan of unnecessary jargon, period. It can prevent outsiders from becoming involved.

It gives off the impression that someone needs to be an engineer to interact with an LLM, which is far from the case.

It's best to say things as simply as possible.

I often see people selling courses for prompt engineering, and that just seems ridiculous to me.","All hype aside, prompt engineering still is definitely a thing. Techniques like chain-of-thought and zero/few shot fall in that category, but going deeper it really involves an understanding of machine learning and how LLMs work so that you can get the best output.

We have a pretty iconic logo/outline of our art and all our posters are basically silhouettes of this big UFO-looking installation. All we ever change is the background colors and some city-specific accents as we tour the country. The variations are small so I feel like perhaps AI could easily make new ones without the costs of having a design firm doing it. Or honestly I wouldn’t mind to keep paying if we just got more content, more variety, and more creativity but we just can’t afford it with human designers. So was hoping someone could recommend an AI tool where we could train it on both our still images and our video content and perhaps it could learn from there to create new stuff for us?

We’d also be happy to hire someone as a consultant to build us a system like this if it meant we could then easily use it self-serve in the future as we gave it new content, new ideas, and new music.

2024-03-21 21:33:14,GenerativeAI,Best solution for a specialized AI assistant that adapts answers to customers,"I’m working on a solution to create an AI assistant for professionals of a specific domain. It would answer questions of their customers when they are not available to do it themselves. The assistant would need to know personal information about the customers like age, gender, physical activity, meal plans and so on. So it would have to adapt the answers according to the customer profile.

My first attempt was to test role play prompts giving chat gpt 4 the user context. As I expected, the answers were not always useful and there was some hallucination. So I moved to investigating the AI solutions in the cloud.

I checked how AI bots are working nowadays and I didn’t see a lot of improvements compared to 8 years ago when I developed a chatbot solution using what used to be called Api.ai (DialogFlow now). We still have to write our own questions, intents, and entities. There is no human-like layer that is added to the conversation.

So I turned to creating models on Azure with my data. I saw I could create an AI project on AI Studio using one of the well known LLMs and test them in the playground with my own data. I also tried the same thing on AI Machine Learning Studio (btw, I didn’t get the difference between the two). It works well but it seems overkill to pay for such service if I want it to use only my knowledge base. Also, I didn’t figure out how I would insert the customer profile on each interaction because I can’t train a model with data + customer profiles. Otherwise, one would know about the other.

I’m not sure this is the best way to go. It seems to me that there are these two paths. One with bots that is still very manual and doesn’t feel like a human interaction. The other one which is much more flexible but we don’t have control over the conversations and it’s very expensive. Am I missing something here?

P.s: I’m testing on Azure because I have credits there but I’m open to switch to other cloud platforms or local solutions.",

2024-03-20 09:45:13,GenerativeAI,What Is Generative AI & How Can I Use It?,"Generative AI is transforming the digital landscape by providing cutting-edge solutions and streamlining operations across all industries. Its integration into workplaces marks a new phase of enhanced productivity, creativity, and informed decision-making. For companies and teams, embracing generative AI is not just beneficial; it has become crucial for staying competitive and driving innovation forward. In this discussion, I delve into the core of Generative AI, its diverse applications in business environments, the significance of team proficiency with this technology, and a snapshot of ethical considerations.

### What Defines Generative AI?

Generative AI involves machine learning algorithms aimed at generating data resembling a given dataset. Unlike rule-based algorithms that perform specific tasks, Generative AI algorithms take input data and produce **new outputs** not originally present in the dataset. This distinction is why it's known as Generative AI because it's creating outputs rather than just rearranging existing inputs. 

When discussing the field of Generative AI you’ll most likely hear its parts referred to as either models or applications. Generative AI **models** are the foundational frameworks needed for developing learning patterns from existing data to generate synthetic data. Generative AI **applications** are practical solutions that utilize these models for tasks, like content creation, image generation, or predictive text generation.

Generative AI encompasses a wide and growing range of artificial intelligence tools that can produce amazing content, solutions, and/or data with human-like insight and inventiveness. These AI systems analyze extensive datasets to grasp patterns, subtleties, and frameworks, empowering them to create outputs once thought to be exclusive to human intelligence – including text generation, image creation, video creation, coding tasks, and even music composition. This capability not only showcases the progress of AI but also unlocks new possibilities for creativity and operational efficiency.

### Utilizing Generative AI in Professional Settings

The adaptability of Generative AI makes it a valuable resource across various industries. In sectors focused on creativity, it facilitates content generation tasks like writing articles or crafting visuals – significantly reducing the time, energy, and resources expended on these activities.

In the realm of software development, it speeds up the coding process by offering suggestions for enhancements, creating code snippets, and pinpointing possible bugs. This boosts both productivity and the quality of the end product.

Within customer service, generative AI can deliver personalized responses to queries, ensuring round-the-clock availability without compromising on interaction quality. Marketing also sees benefits as AI creates tailored content, ads, and strategies based on analyzing consumer data. This drives higher engagement and conversion rates. 

These practical uses highlight how generative AI has the potential to revolutionize traditional workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and open up new creative avenues.

“I think about it as reducing the toil that people have to do today with a lot of repetitive mundane tasks, which increases job satisfaction but also boosts output.” - [Chris Bedi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbedi/),  Chief Digital Information Officer at [ServiceNow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/servicenow/) 

### Reasons Why Your Team Should Embrace Generative AI

The shift towards AI-centric business environments is happening now and it requires teams to become proficient in utilizing generative AI tools. Familiarity with such technologies enables teams to fully leverage AI's capabilities in streamlining workflows, developing innovative solutions, and making well-informed decisions. It nurtures a culture of ongoing learning and adaptability crucial in today's rapidly changing digital landscape. Furthermore, a grasp of generative AI empowers teams to spot opportunities for its application, anticipate potential obstacles, and contribute towards developing ethical and sustainable AI solutions.

You can now create your very own Gen AI expert that knows everything there is to know about your business. If you onboard a new sales agent, the agent can instantly know everything they need to know about their new role by simply and naturally interacting with this Gen AI virtual expert. That’s exactly what ServiceNow did to train their sales team.

“We indexed all the content and they could literally ask it any question, and the same applies to a virtual expert in IT, HR, Customer Service, the list goes on and on. We’re live on about 20+ use cases internally and we’re only getting started.” - [Chris Bedi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbedi?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAANlAgBxu44CQlHlmg3o0jTGcOJLCk7YFY), Chief Digital Information Officer at [ServiceNow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/servicenow/)

One of the biggest applications of Generative AI is employee productivity. ServiceNow performed a study that stated that, on average, employees spend 30% to 45% of their time on administrative tasks. In response, ServiceNow deployed a Gen AI that allows its employees to ask something in natural language. Gen AI understands the intent and 99% of the time the employee gets a Gen AI response.

“What we saw on the back end is a 14% reduction in the work that's coming to those back office departments and that's in about five months! So think about it. It’s only going to get better. Now the employees get their answers quicker so they’re more productive and effective, the back office is doing less of that mundane repetitive stuff so they can do other more strategic things. So we’ve applied that sort of rinse and repeat across any request or service organization” - [Chris Bedi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbedi?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAANlAgBxu44CQlHlmg3o0jTGcOJLCk7YFY), Chief Digital Information Officer at [ServiceNow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/servicenow/)

“Knowledge discovery is a huge problem in almost any company. Not just for employees who are onboarding... Say an employee is about to have a child and needs to know what they need to do with benefits. So it’s everything from answering questions like that to understanding how they need to do their work on a day-to-day basis that’s actually powered by this technology. I actually find that the bigger challenge is presenting AI and Gen AI as a means to augment work, whereas on the technical side, it sells itself.” - [Sabry Tozin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabtozin?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAxwG4Btq887vn8uMxOGmlNyZCMRPl81fU), VP - Engineering, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) 

### How to Begin to Integrate Generative AI in the Workplace

If you haven’t already started embracing this new form of technology then you’re already falling behind. Take time to research which departments would most benefit from Generative AI. Open the conversation up to the team. Give your team the tools they need to try it out. Regularly check in with them to see what they’ve learned. Ask, what did you try? What worked? What didn’t work? 

We’ve reached a new frontier. AI is no longer reserved for a specialized tiny workforce. Everybody can start using it now to explore how it can benefit their department and/or position. Hands-on experience is one of the most valuable strategies you can implement in helping your team build their skillset and understanding of the technology as a whole.

### Ethical Considerations Surrounding Generative AI

As we welcome generative AI into our lives, ethical concerns come into focus. The capacity of AI to create content that mirrors human output raises questions about authenticity, copyright issues, and the risk of misuse.

It is crucial to use AI-generated content responsibly by being transparent about its origins and adhering to ethical guidelines. Define what that means in your organization and raise the question to your industry as a whole. Address any biases in AI algorithms to prevent the perpetuation of stereotypes or inequalities.

In conclusion, generative AI significantly advances our ability to innovate, create, and enhance efficiency across various domains. As we increasingly incorporate it into our work and creative processes, understanding its capabilities, applications and ethical considerations is vital. By approaching generative AI thoughtfully regarding its potential and challenges, your team can unlock new levels of productivity and creativity, ensuring they stay ahead in technological progress.

I'm working on a thesis about using generative AI to modernize COBOL mainframes and I'd appreciate your insights. My work revolves more around trying to extract the meaning of the cobol code.

Here are my main questions:

COBOL Mainframes: What are some unique challenges when dealing with these systems? Any resources to deepen my understanding would be appreciated.

Generative AI and COBOL: Has anyone worked on similar projects or knows of relevant research about using generative AI in the context of COBOL?

Potential Pitfalls: What issues might I encounter? How can I mitigate these risks?

Case Studies: Are there successful examples of AI being used to modernize legacy systems?

Future Implications: What could be the potential impact of successfully using generative AI for COBOL modernization 

I'm open to any other suggestions or advice. Thank you in advance for your help!",

Hi Pals,

I am hosting a 12-mo event comparing two image generative AI's: Adobe Firefly and Midjourney. But my posts were deleted by the moderator of Midjourney and Photoshop. So I am posting the comparison here. Hopefully here is the right place for it.

The event is designed to last from Jan 2024 till Dec 2024. Now it is the third month of the event.

Here are the links to the comparisons for March (The deadline for making a valid vote is 2024-03-31):

The prompts are generated by ChatGPT, but they are very similar to the previous ones. I would try to use another prompt to force ChatGPT to create very different results.

2024-03-10 17:11:04,GenerativeAI,Claude 3 + Function Calling with `claudetools`,"**Claudetools** is a Python library for function calling that implements function calling using Anthropic's Claude 3 family of models. Function calling is one of the most important features provided by OpenAI GPT APIs right out of the box.

With other open-source LLMs and other LLM API providers, we don't get the same out of the box. Furthermore, open-source LLMs are only decent at generating structured text and hence, we get inconsistent outputs when we use those for function calling. Up until now, there were no competitors to OpenAI's GPT models in terms of function calling. But now with the release of the Claude 3 family of models that's about to change. 

The Claude 3 family of models is great at generating structured text. Because of the same reason I started developing a function calling use case and the outputs are quite fantastic. The outputs can be easily compared with the function calling output obtained from GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo.

You can check out the package here: https://github.com/vatsalsaglani/claudetools.

Feedback and contributions are welcome.",Are you using this with a frontend chatbot yet? I develop Web Requests which has the following spec of functions available. Could you make some demo calls showing Claude using web requests to connect itself to the web or other API services by just providing it my existing spec? https://github.com/RealJD2020/Web-Requests-for-ChatGPT/blob/main/OpenAPI-Spec.md

The first ""1"" is clothed and the second ""1"" isn't. To the right side, there is the Python function ""abs()"" in a cartoonish style. The two ""1""s enter into the ""abs()"" and get out on the right side. The '1's on the right side are not clothed. This expresses the function of ""abs()"" that strips the sign of numerics.`

I later modified the prompt thus - ""Act as a illustrator to explain a programming topic. I want you to pictorially explain the meaning of the Python function abs() through an educational cartoon. Create a simple, minimalist cartoon as follows: show a queue with figures before and after an entrance. those behind the entrance are dressed in an astronaut suit. Those who have crossed the entrance are without the suit. On top of the entrance there should be a board with ""abs()"" written on it""

I've been brainstorming with bots to generate art \[ [https://mvark.blogspot.com/search/label/BrainstormedWithBots](https://mvark.blogspot.com/search/label/BrainstormedWithBots) \] and here are my suggestions. After inspecting the cartoons both generated, I feel the prompt describing the output could be simplified to represent a single concrete action.

I feel currently you are describing an animation and a too detailed visualization. Frame your prompt as if you're talking to an artist who doesn't know Python or programming. As the AI assistants can come up with a lot of creative images that may not still be the output you desire, use the output of each prompt to keep refining your prompt. 

I doubt if you'll get exactly what you want but with some editing of the generated images, you may get close. Good luck!"

I can imagine someone using a dead parent's photo to tell their spouse they are a failure as a person, and will be divorced. Imagine the emotional trauma. 

Legally, this could lead to court cases of domestic abuse, with an emotional component of trauma. Having watched ""Chowchilla"" on Netflix, ""People v. Schoenfeld"" was about imprisoning 3 men for burying a schoolbus full of children. None of them were harmed over the course of 36 hours, and eventually the accused appealed and changed life terms to be nullified since it was only psychological abuse. 

I don't know if the two could possibly be related, but the amount of PTSD many of those kids suffered over the next 45+ years was severe. We're fairly fragile beings, but we're going to have to learn, culturally, to trust what is real and touchable in front of us more than what we see on devices connected to software. Otherwise, we're a busful of children buried in the ground unaware of why we're suddenly transformed from passengers in life to victims of emotional abuse. 

It would be interesting to note legal ramifications of AI abuse like this.

On another note, it's incredibly fascinating. Too bad dead celebrities aren't able to defend their legacies. Perhaps other laws will come into effect as we see history being rewritten, and reputations damaged."

2024-02-26 16:31:06,GenerativeAI,"""Summer Nights"" - AI Music Video Spec | By Justin R. Kaplan","Sound on. Here is my first AI music video spec! This is an example of a music video pitch for an artist or label using a song I generated. Shots and music generated with Ai. Editing, sound design and polishing in premiere. Working full time as a CD in the event industry has made it difficult to find time to explore these new tools, so I challenged myself to generate a song and footage using AI and complete this proof of concept while testing the current tools (while we wait for Sora). I created this short video on a MacBook Air over the last few nights. After working with traditional workflows/methods for over 15 years, It's been exciting to have these new tools in the arsenal and experiment through this type of lens, particularly in the pre-pro/conceptualization phase.

Over my career as a CD and filmmaker, I've produced, directed, and edited 30+ music videos for independent artists and large labels. I’ve always gravitated towards music videos as a secondary creative outlet because, like most people, I love music, and It’s a really neat meshing of filmmaking, branding, and music. Previously, I’ve used a standard vision board and treatment presentation in my pitches. These were effective in conveying the ideas in my head to clients, but how cool is it to be able to communicate my vision in this new, original, and immersive way? You really can't beat the authenticity when compared to my pasted google or pinterest images that were all created by other artists.

Things are quickly changing and we can’t stop the process. It's our role as creatives and innovators to push forward and embrace change. So many brilliant people who have ideas and stories to tell can now be seen. There’s no getting rid of storytellers, we’re now more empowered than ever. Use these tools as a collaborator and conceptualizer in the creative process. We’re not just focussed on the final output. It’s not just prompting, it's not just ai, we are humans, creators, and decision makers with a vision and point of view. Here’s to 2024 and beyond! Happy to share my workflow if anyone is interested. :\]

I wanted to know if we can download open source GenAI models and use them in an isolated environment by fine tuning them to retrieve needed data and answer the questions asked based on it. 

I've started to learn LangChain and ig we can do that using it. If the whole system needs to be on cloud, how do we  basically host this whole thing?

Will there be any security issues like some leakage points in the downloaded model itself such that it steals data from us?

Any input or suggestions will be helpful and appreciated. Thanks.","Yes, it can be done and no data leakage will happen. You can follow this to understand how to do it : https://youtu.be/3ykNbUHRg2A?si=Kpi2OXmHzJ0ca7bA"

Working with a Generative AI startup for businesses. The main idea is to have an assistant that never sleeps, never gets sick or calls in. The platform integrates with anything your business uses such as outlook, Dropbox, QuickBooks, CRM's etc. And instead of searching through multiple different sources, you would simply ask our platform to pull the data. It can also pull analytics on your business for financials, leads and much more. 

Example: Law Firm

Lawyers get thousands of documents every month with the same information generally and you have to scroll through pages and pages to find the data you already know if there but still need to find it. 

You would ask ""Pull blood report from case #1234 and search for similar cases, outcomes and strategies."" 

The Generative AI will the blood report from that case in seconds and also search through previous cases and give potential outcomes and strategies. Saving you time and allowing you to focus on key strategies that have worked in the past. 

This is just one use case for this platform. I was curious to see if there are any employees or business owners that could find this useful for their business.","Is not that Microsoft copilot is? It can read your outlook, MS office docs etc"

2024-02-09 20:49:36,GenerativeAI,Data Access for LLMs is broken. Thoughts?,"Hey  all. To build truly useful GenAI apps, LLMs need to be able to access  propriety data from structured and unstructured data sources. LLMs  struggle to understand the availability, location, and methods to  retrieve relevant data.

Key problems:

1. LLMs can’t identify if the necessary data is available to answer a user query in any of the data sources.
2. If the data is available, LLMs can’t locate which data source to retrieve from.
3. If  the source is known, writing retrieval pipelines  (text-to-SQL, text-to-Cypher, text-to-JSON, etc.) for the numerous retrieval protocols is complicated, repetitive, and non-deterministic.

Some suggest fine-tuning or RAG as potential solutions but:

1. Fine-tuning  models with specific data is expensive, becomes outdated with the  latest data, and has in-built access control issues. Continuous  retraining is costly and doesn’t keep pace with real-time data changes.
2. RAG  doesn’t work with structured data. Most useful data is structured and  can be spread across numerous data sources, each with its own querying  mechanism.
3. Writing individual retrieval pipelines are limited and complicated and don’t ensure determinism, security, and access control.

Have  you faced these issues in your projects? What workarounds or solutions  have you found effective? Any new tools or practices that simplify  integrating LLMs with diverse data sources?",

Hello everyone !

Does anyone know AI service that allows to train model on 20-30 pics that contain some object (your selfies for example) and then generate images with prompts like ""My\_Custom\_Object on the balcony with the cup of tea looking at the sunset , hyper realistic etc etc "" ?

I know Stable Diffusion's Dreambooth can do that and as far as i know all mobile apps that are marketed as ""AI editors"" use exactly this technology but results are really awful. You have to try hundreds of prompts to generate 1 or 2 really nice pics where you look really like yourself.

Its hard to believe that Midjourney/DALL-E/Google Imageno/etc do not offer something similar. I'm ready to pay for premium account if it does matter, its not a problem.

Any ideas ?  
Thanks in advance.",

One key highlight is the anticipated support for Rich Communication Services (RCS) within the native Messages app. Apple had previously announced plans to introduce RCS support to iPhones in 2024, aiming to facilitate cross-platform functionality between iOS and Android devices. RCS capabilities include enhanced media sharing, improved group chats, read receipts, typing indicators, and messaging over Wi-Fi.

The second major aspect of iOS 18 will be the enhancement of Siri through advancements in [**artificial intelligence**](https://techchilli.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-artificial-intelligence-terminologies-glossary/) (AI). Sources indicate that Apple is likely to introduce generative AI capabilities powered by its large language model (LLM), which will revolutionize Siri’s functionality and extend to other native apps like Messages. These AI enhancements will enable Siri to better understand and respond to user queries, as well as provide auto-complete suggestions for sentences.

Sadly though, some of my photos are not appropriately good quality, due to a glass glare, exposure being off. In other cases, I have an excellent quality portrait photo but the background is ugly or distracting.

I've heard about paid services online that offer AI generated portrait photos for online dating platforms. Some of these I came across lately are: [photoai.com](https://photoai.com/), [photoai.me](https://photoai.me/), [roast.dating](https://roast.dating/). However, I'm quite reluctant to pay for such services if I'm unaware of the quality they can provide. Furthermore, it is also unclear whether any of these services allow for an interactive, iterative photo retouching via prompting, similar to how ChatGPT works for text generation. Or do these services just create portraits with specific settings that they have been programmed to, with little or no customization possible? How about piratediffusion and stable2go?

I'm also curious to hear about the currently best available open-source alternatives. I do have some experience with Python so a bit of coding and experimentation with models on HuggingFace or elsewhere wouldn't scare me away. What would you recommend? ",Consider exploring paid services and open-source alternatives to find the best solution that meets your image generation and retouching criteria for your dating profile.

2024-01-06 15:22:01,GenerativeAI,"I made a Generative AI ""content mill"" that generates videos using GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, DALL-E 3, and TTS","I've embarked on an intriguing journey to explore the potential of automated content generation using OpenAI's API. The result is a unique project that leverages the capabilities of GPT, DALL-E, and TTS to create an AI-powered ""debate video"" on any given topic.

&#x200B;

Upon running the script, you're prompted to input a topic and the names of the debaters. The system then employs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to orchestrate a dynamic debate, moderated and all. Once the debate script is ready, OpenAI's TTS steps in to generate distinct audio clips for each speaker. To add a visual element, DALL-E 3 is used to create images that align with the audio clips. Finally, all these elements are woven together into a cohesive video using moviepy.

&#x200B;

While this project is currently in its proof-of-concept stage, it's evident that it works. The quality of the output, however, is subjective and open to interpretation.

&#x200B;

To give you a glimpse of the results, here's a link to a YouTube playlist:

2) What are the legal implications of generative AI for the company

Prove me wrong, but I’ve not seen what I call ‘a video’ made by AI. All the output looks more like a moving image. (Although technically it consists of multiple frames)

My point is that the look and feel of the output is a very very small nice of video. Like how people would turn foto’s into small videos in after effects.

This has a couple of differences with videos I think. It lacks:
- Introducing new elements in the video or change of scene/background
- posture, joints are very fixt and objects tend to move minimal.
- timing, it always feels like time is divided by 10 in the results.
- I don’t see a lot of physics in the results.

*Disclaimer:
I don’t particularly like the negative tone of my post. But it’s more a result of longing for the technology and hoping to find some peaks into that in the positive restoring comments!

**Generative AI applications in healthcare:**  


Generative AI aids in the optimisation of patient scheduling and resource allocation by taking into account elements such as patient preferences, urgency, and resource availability. Medical image analysis, such as X-rays and MRIs, must be accurate and quick for diagnosis and treatment planning. The examination of medical images is automated using generative AI, which aids in the detection of anomalies and provides correct diagnoses. This results in better patient outcomes.  


**Generative AI applications in marketing and advertising:**  


Businesses want to increase conversion rates by targeting certain client categories with targeted adverts and content. Generative AI uses demographic, psychographic, and behavioural data to offer personalised adverts and messaging to specific customer categories.

  
**Generative AI applications in entertainment:**  


Creating engaging characters and worlds for video games and other forms of entertainment needs imagination and innovation. Original music compositions and sound effects are generated by generative AI. It offers distinct audio experiences for games and other forms of entertainment material. Generative AI streamlines the content creation process by automating animation and visual effects production.  


**Generative AI applications in finance:**

&#x200B;

Generative AI analyzes vast amounts of financial data, market trends and individual preferences to generate optimized investment strategies. This helps investors make informed decisions and maximize returns.

Detecting and preventing fraudulent activities in financial transactions and operations is a significant challenge. Generative AI leverages advanced algorithms to identify patterns and detect anomalies in financial transactions. This enables financial institutions to detect and prevent fraud early.  
 

**Stay ahead of the curve by adopting generative AI technology now!**

Generative AI is transforming industries across the board. It offers innovative solutions, enhances productivity and enables new forms of creativity. We are witnessing the exponential growth and adoption of generative AI. This technology is not just a trend but a powerful tool that will continue to shape the future of industries worldwide.",Great content! there's also a lot of application for education too.

This is how Clemory does it: 

1. Clemory scans the website of the link you insert in less than 4 seconds. 
2. It draws out the real essence of the content - no ads, no pop-ups.
3. Regardless of how long the website is, Clemory generates a summary of it in one paragraph. 
4. Below the summary, Clemory pastes the original texts in the website which are of course editable, annotatable and exportable.

2023-11-30 18:39:03,GenerativeAI,How can GPT model perform Big integer calculations without actually being trained on it?,"I'm a programmer and have a general understanding how Neural Networks work and how they're trained.

I asked ChatGPT (3.5 and 4) a simple computational question assuming that the model wasn't trained on that exact sample. (I even doubt it can be ptentially trained on any BigInt computations technically because of near infinite input space) Am I wrong?

The question:

>Find greatest common divider of 12313669214 and 24689801381.

GPT3.5 answer (reduced):

>Let's find the GCD of 12313669214 and 24689801381 using the Euclidean algorithm:  
>  
>Step 1. Divide 24689801381 by 12313669214. 24689801381÷12313669214=2 with a remainder of 68  
>  
>Step 2. Now, replace the larger number with the smaller number and the remainder:12313669214÷68=181041017 with a remainder of 10  
>  
>Step 3. Next iteration:68÷10=6 with a remainder of 8  
>  
>Step 4. Another iteration:10÷8=1 with a remainder of 2  
>  
>Step 5. Final iteration:8÷2=4 with a remainder of 0​  
>  
>Since the remainder became zero, the last non-zero remainder before it  became zero was 2. Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of  12313669214 and 24689801381 is 2.

GPT4 answer:

>Sure, let’s calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12313669214 and 24689801381 using the Euclidean method.  
>  
>The Euclidean method works by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then using the remainder of this operation as the new smaller number. This process is repeated until the remainder is zero, at which point the smaller number is the GCD.  
>  
>Here’s how it works:  
>  
>Divide 24689801381 by 12313669214 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 62462953.  
>  
>Now, divide 12313669214 by 62462953 to get a quotient of 197 and a remainder of 0.  
>  
>So, the greatest common divisor of 12313669214 and 24689801381 is **62462953**.

Both are incorrect, the answer should be 122717.

From the answers above I can see that it often makes mistakes in the remainder computation. However only once it was able to ""calculate"" the remainder correctly, see

>Divide 24689801381 by 12313669214 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 62462953

I was surprised because NNs are just a prediction models and can't predict/approximate a computation result if the training samples didn't have it. I doubt OpenAI/Microsoft has trained their models with such specific remainders computation because of 1) near infinite input space 2) approximation may not work with this kind of numbers

Where am i mistaken? Can someone explain how the GPT model was able to predict the remainder result? Is it just a coincidence? Or maybe it has a scientific calculator hidden in some layer of NN? :)","I don't know the answer but I got similar mistakes from 3.5 and now 4. Even Bard, Claude and other LLMs make these mistakes. Who knows with billions of features going in, it's a black box. Can't figure out what set of features led to this mistake. Not only calculations, it hallucinates even when it comes to text outputs"

23 Oct 2023    
Ruoxi Shi, Hansheng Chen, Zhuoyang Zhang, Minghua Liu, Chao Xu, Xinyue Wei, Linghao Chen, Chong Zeng, Hao Su ·  Edit social preview  
We report Zero123++, an image-conditioned diffusion model for generating 3D-consistent multi-view images from a single input view. To take full advantage of pretrained 2D generative priors, we develop various conditioning and training schemes to minimize the effort of finetuning from off-the-shelf image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. Zero123++ excels in producing high-quality, consistent multi-view images from a single image, overcoming common issues like texture degradation and geometric misalignment. Furthermore, we showcase the feasibility of training a ControlNet on Zero123++ for enhanced control over the generation process.

2023-10-26 09:19:12,GenerativeAI,"What qualities does generative AI have that humans could never, and what audio can it produce that is truly novel?","I am no AI expert, but working on it for my thesis. What are your thoughts on the following questions:

* What qualities does generative AI have, that humans do not and could never? (e.g. finding patterns in huge amounts of data)
* What audio content can generative AI produce that is **truly** novel, and could not be produced without it? I am working on audio/music, and obviously generative AI can create new melodies, songs, instrumentals. These are things human could create as well, they just need more time/skill. But the only thing I came up with that is truly novel are sounds, because AI can mix 2 sounds and turn it into 1 new sound that did not exist before. Are there more things like this, that could not be created without generative AI?","I don't think generative ai does something that humans cannot or is capable of doing things that is superhuman with one exception which I will tell later in this comment.

The human brain is amazing. It is extraordinary adept at finding patterns in data, it even does this so well your brain is overactive and you recognize shapes in clouds. Hear voices in the wind and get that feeling something is behind you in the dark. Got you! The brain is processing such a vast amount of sensory data that outruns any mega dataset for any neural network. Hell, our brains get fed a giga dataset every second and is so well trained it knows what data to throw away without 'you' even noticing it. Within its fucking awesomeness the brain is limited though. It cannot think of new colours, it cannot invent new unique animals and it cannot dream about faces it hasn't seen before. Whenever you dream about some stranger, you have seen that stranger in real life once somewhere in the streets or in some media outlet. And this is the same with generative ai. Neural networks are incapable of making new things that are outside its dataset, the same as the brain. If it has not been trained on generating images of bees it will never show you a bee or some mashup of a bee. Neural networks are absolutely awesome at what they should do but nothing outside those boundaries, you can see them as highly skilled but also highly irrational beings. Trained on human portraits? The network will give you realistic non-existing but mashed up believable portraits. But ask it to make a kitten and it will give you an awesome human portrait once more. They are the ultimate remixing machines.

To get back at the exception I mentioned at the start, the neural network when trained can be prompt indefinitely without exhaustion. If you ask me to draw a house or make a rythm I can give you one just as fast as an ai would. Ask me to do a couple of hundred of those within a minute and I am effectively giving you the finger and going for a smoke. The network however will declare his name is Lightning McQueen and will give you as many results as you desire or the bandwidth allows. This is where the ai truly excells and transcends us humans, they are insufferable in what they do. (Given that the output is not fed into the network again as with LSTM-networks and you overtrain or exhaust the network) so what you asked in your comment is kind of the wrong question because the things you mentioned is something humans has done for centuries, it's what made is great. It is the speed in which networks can do those things and give us many options or sketches to choose from within minutes that would take us weeks."

I started to study LLM. There are a couple of things I still don't understand.

It would be great to get some help from the community.

&#x200B;

What I understood:

* Input of datasets is embedded (tokenization) and computed into weights (different values such as self-attention, positional encoding, etc.). This happens on a set of distributed GPUs.
* The more relevant and high quality of the datasets the more relevant the weights are for specific use cases (customer support, manufacturing, etc.).
* We have no details of datasets that trained the public models (chatGPT 4, Falcon, LLAMA 2, etc.)

Correct me if my understanding is mistaken.

&#x200B;

What I don't understand:

* What happens exactly when we input a prompt? (the prompt will be tokenized and matched with the LLM tokens and weights?)
* When we give feedback to the LLMs (RLHF), will that change some of their weights to the better (more relevant)?
* When we do fine-tuning, do we just add new tokens and calculate new weights? Or we change some of the existing weights?
* When we fine-tune a closed model like ChatGPT, the new weights are calculated thanks to private data, are they also available to others?

&#x200B;

Thank you very much in advance.

&#x200B;","These are excellent questions and I'm trying to understand them myself. I'm not sure if you have input these directly into GPT, you will find that it actually knows a lot about itself and is good about explaining these things.

I want to start this discussion off with a basic question. There is no need to have extensive or professional knowledge on the subject, enthusiasts are welcome!","Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, music, audio, and videos, using generative models. Generative models are machine learning models that learn the patterns and structure of a given dataset and then generate new data that has similar characteristics. For example, a generative model trained on a dataset of human faces can generate new faces that look realistic but do not belong to any real person.  
There are different types of generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, and transformers. Each of these models has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the task and the data. For instance, GANs are good at producing high-quality images, but they are difficult to train and prone to mode collapse. Transformers are good at generating natural language, but they require a lot of computational resources and data.  
Generative AI has many applications in creative activities, data enrichment, problem-solving, and more. For example, generative AI can be used to synthesize new images for art or entertainment, augment existing data for training or testing purposes, solve complex optimization problems, or generate novel ideas or solutions."

2023-10-05 05:24:07,GenerativeAI,What is generative AI and how does it work,,"Generative AI is basically a form of artificial intelligence that collects data and information all around the internet that allows for it to combine patterns within answers to similarly related questions and form you a unique answer based on what you are asking for. Whether your prompt is a question that needs an answer or solution, an image that you want generated, or the use of voices within a database, generative AI is used to meet your needs within an instant. The programmers of the AI train the technology by storing the information that is new and up to date in a way that allows for AI to go through and connect patterns to give you the best and most ideal response instantaneously."
2023-10-05 05:23:41,GenerativeAI,"Can generative AI be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes, such as to reduce product/service cost, improve customer service, improve employee productivity, etc.? Why or why not? And how? Please provide illustrative examples to support your arguments.",,"AI can be used to reduce product and service cost over time because after the initial payment gets covered by sales, there is no recurring costs like if you were to have a human employee that you have to pay hourly. There will be some maintenance costs over time it will still be less overtime."
2023-10-05 05:23:08,GenerativeAI,What are the legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings?,,"Generative AI faces a lot of legal and ethical issues. The three biggest risks involve biased and false information, copyright and intellectual property issues, and data privacy violations. When generative AI platforms learn from biased information, they further distribute incorrect information that can lead to discrimination and inequality, which also leads to more polarization as a result of these initial shortcomings. This year, a lawyer used a fake case in a trial because a legal researcher from their team had used ChatGPT for preparation on the research for the case. No one was aware that the case did not exist, and because they did not fact check it, this had severe implications and raised a variety of questions regarding the matter. Copyright and intellectual property rights are another key issue since generative AI uses existing information to create something new. This means that songs can be based off of a few existing songs, which could result in copyright claims. Lastly, data privacy concerns are seen through the utilization of deepfakes in the entertainment industry. The utilization of someone's likeness and image without their consent and any compensation raises a variety of legal and ethical concerns, not to mention the job instability that it causes, which leads to greater economic instability. There are countless other issues, however, these three areas of focus are a few of the biggest and most pressing issues regarding generative AI today."
2023-10-05 05:22:38,GenerativeAI,What are the key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization?,,"There are several major obstacles to applying generative AI to new concepts for organizational strategic advantages. Data quantity and quality come first and foremost. Generative AI models need large, high-quality datasets for effective training. It can take a lot of time and money to collect and curate such data for specialized or proprietary applications. Second, it's critical to take ethical concerns about bias and fairness into account. Generative AI can result in discriminatory outcomes by unintentionally reinforcing biases discovered in the training data. Organizations must implement stringent bias detection and mitigation strategies in order to ensure fairness and equity in AI-generated content or decisions. Thirdly, the ""black box"" nature of some generative AI models may make them more difficult to understand and transparent. Understanding how these models generate results is crucial in regulated industries where explainability is essential for compliance and trust. In conclusion, when generative AI is used for innovation and strategic advantages, problems with data quality, moral considerations, model transparency, cybersecurity risks, and organizational adaptation arise. Effectively addressing these problems is crucial if generative AI is to fully realize its potential for organizational success. There is not really a space where this question is answered in one string, so the information that I gathered for this answer is a combined answer of about 5 other comments and threads in this subreddit."

Businesses may employ generative AI to create marketing content like blog posts, social media updates, and even ad copy. In addition to saving time and money, this preserves a consistent brand voice. Implementing generative AI-powered chatbots may enhance customer service. These bots are able to understand and respond to client enquiries, provide information on products or services, and even assist with simple problem-solving, all of which improve customer satisfaction. Generative AI's capacity to assess massive datasets and identify patterns and trends facilitates strategic decision-making. In order to provide perspectives into product updates or market trends, it can, for example, look at consumer feedback. This helps firms make informed decisions. The use of generative AI has the potential to modify several organizational aspects and further strategic goals. Businesses may utilize generative AI to create marketing content like blog posts, social media updates, and even ad copy. This saves time and money while also maintaining a consistent brand voice.

2023-10-04 21:46:59,GenerativeAI,What is generative AI and how does it work?,,"Generative AI or Generative artificial intelligence relies on pre-existing datasets, rather than actively collecting data from the internet. During its testing phases, human researchers and data scientists curate and process these datasets, teaching the AI to recognize patterns and relationships within the data. When users provide prompts or input on sites like ChatGPT, the AI leverages its learned patterns to generate content or answers that are coherent and contextually relevant. This process is not real-time data collection but rather a result of the model's training."

If this is the case, would there be any way that generative ai could come up with something **truly** innovative? Wouldn't it just be re-designing and re-inventing things that already exist?","I teach innovation. Innovation is not the same as Invention, and Invention is what it seems like you are referring to.

Invention = create something for the first time ever in the history of the world.

Innovation = apply something in a new way that creates value.

So, yes, generative AI creates tons and tons and tons of innovation. It continually is doing things in new ways that creates value.

So it is also inventing things? Yes! Again, the content it is creating has likely never been created before. That doesn't mean it doesn't have a root in some prior concept or tech--literally everything invented has similar roots.

As the evening unfolded, our AI demonstrated remarkable adaptability, leaving me both surprised and delighted.  


What unfolded over the course of the evening exceeded our expectations. Our AI seamlessly immersed itself in the vibrant atmosphere of the bar, engaging in conversations with various patrons about the upcoming community event, the Urban Regatta.  


One of the most impressive aspects of our AI's performance was its ability to adapt to different interviewee roles. As conversations flowed, it adeptly shifted between styles and questions, tailoring its approach to each participant. This dynamic adaptability was especially crucial in maintaining engaging and contextually relevant interactions.  


This success fuels our enthusiasm to move forward with our community AI project. The potential applications are abundant, from enhancing event coverage to strengthening community bonds. We are excited about the possibilities and committed to further refining our AI to continue bridging the gap between technology and community engagement.

2023-08-27 00:17:04,GenerativeAI,Why is AI necessary for quality image upscaling?,"I don't know where to post this question. So if it seems off-topic, feel free to remove it.

I've had a couple AI LLM's try to explain this to me today. Either I am just too dense to understand, or they aren't explaining it very well (probably the former). 

Can someone explain to me why AI is necessary to upscale photos? I just don't get it. If I have a photo that is N pixels wide and N pixels high that is 300 DPI, and I want to scale it to N x 4 pixels wide and N x 4 pixels high (retaining 300 DPI), why can't existing pixels just be multiplied (so there are more of them). Why is AI necessary to calculate new pixels?","Think of the reverse: there are many different combinations of 2x2 pixels that downscale to 1 pixel, if you were to lower the resolution. So if you want to upscale, which one should the algorithm pick? 
The naive way is to just duplicate the pixel, so you have a 2x2 patch of the same color. If you zoom into that, it's just blurry. 
The slightly more sophisticated way is to have something that looks at the edges and patterns in the image and fills in the details based on that. That works pretty well for some applications, but tends to have visible artifacts. 
The AI approach uses a model that's learned what the upscale version of a patch tends to be in high resolution images given the low resolution version. That also means that if you use an upscaler that was trained on, say, anime images, and you use it on a photograph, you'll get weird results."
